# Analysis of the multi-hazard risk in the Kathmandu Valley

* A GIS analysis was conducted, and the Kathmandu Valley was used as a sample study area. This encompasses the region surrounding the Nepalese capital, Kathmandu, and is a suitable example, as this region has been severely affected by the three natural hazards studied: floods, landslides, and earthquakes.

## Getting started

* The code is entirely contained in a Jupyter notebook and was developed with Python in VS Code. The working environment is managed with the [Miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge) distribution using **mamba/conda**, and the complete environment configuration is provided as a `.yaml` file in this repository for easy reproducibility.

### Dependencies

Before running the notebook, you need to have:
- Python 3.11.*
- [Miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge), Anaconda/Miniconda or other preferred environment
- JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook
- The required packages listed in the `environment.yaml`

### Installing and executing programm

After following the steps of installing the miniforge dsitribution
1. Create the environment from the provided `.yaml` file:
    ```
    [mamba or conda] env create -f environment.yaml
    ```
2.  Activate the environment:
    ```
    [mamba or conda] activate Risk_analysis
    ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook in VS Code or JupyterLaband select right kernel (Risk_analysis) and run all cells

## Result

The following shows the endresult of the analysis:
